to run Ruby code you first have to create a Ruby file and then run that file.
ruby files end with RB ex:
example.rb

next use the bash command "ruby" with the arguement <file name>. ex:
$ ruby example.rb
and the output would be the result of running that ruby file.

Can also run ruby commands directly in bash by using irb which creates a ruby environment in the commmand line.
$ irb <enter>
<ruby commands> ~ runs the ruby commands without having to create a ruby file.
exit ~ leaves ruby environment
  note that commands run in irb will also print what the function returns. In the case of the put command it returns "nil"

notes continued in ruby_style_guide.txt

assigning variables use a single = sign

defining a method:
def method_name
  stuff_method_does
end
  ? are there no parenthesis or end punctuation?

Book: Introduction to Programming with Ruby

Use one git repository for all exercises in the Ruby book. (Remember: don't nest git repositories.)
Create a folder within that repository for each chapter in the book.
Create a separate file for every exercise in the chapter.

Notes moving to repository

Ruby Version Manager

sometimes code will only run on a certain version of Ruby
  rather then installing and uninstalling Ruby the solution is to use a ruby version manager
  RVM recommended for cloud9 or Linux
  check if rvm is already installed on Cloud9 by typing rvm --help
  rvm is installed
